### Velocity
1. **Milestone 1 (2 Weeks)**
Iteration 1: We predicted our velocity to be 0.5. The stories for the first iteration was not completed in time,
we expected  roughly 10(hr/week) * 6 = 60 work hours to be expended, & only completed around 25.5 hours worth
estimated hours for tasks, so ended with a velocity of 0.425.

Iteration 2: With the last iteration velocity being around 0.425 & now that we have a better idea of what the stories
are, we predict our velocity will improve and therefore decide it's likely to be 0.5. The velocity ended up being
around the same as certain members become busy with midterms, around 24 hours of work, 31/65 (we spent 5 more combined hours than last iteration)
and a velocity of 0.477.


3. **Milestone 2**
After going through MS1 we planned that it would take us 56.5 hours to complete all our tasks,
yet it ended up taking us 125 hours to complete all our tasks. This gives us a velocity of 56.5/125 which is 0.452,
slightly lower than our 0.5 velocity. We predict a velocity of 0.452, and total hours we predict for this milestone is 34.

Iteration 1: We predict velocity of 0.452 since it was our velocity for last milestone. This time we had stories that we
predicted would take roughly 21 work hours, we expended about 50 work hours, giving a velocity of 0.42. 

Iteration 2: With only 13 hours left for the remaining tasks, we spent roughly 50 work hours, as we spent a lot of time
going over missing tests & debugging. This gives us a particularly low velocity for this iteration, at 0.26.
